# basilisk
Reimagining the classic Nokia Snake Game for linux terminals and consoles

## Linux consoles
This game uses `tty` and `termios` to run a version of the classic game Snake on your linux device. This game uses ASCII graphics inspired by the popular game [moria](https://umoria.org/). This gme also supports several powerups that make gameplay far more intriguing than the classic game.

## Installation
- Download the file `basilisk.py`.
- Move it to `~/bin/` and rename it simply to `basilisk`.
- Make the file executable using
  ```chmod +x basilisk```
- The directory `~/bin/` needs to be part of your `$PATH`. It usually is, so don't worry. If it isn't, find out how to add it.

## Playing
Just run the command `basilisk` from anywhere, and use the arrow keys to control.
